# Cargo GCCRS

Gaining support for cargo via rustc-wrapper

This project is *not* usable yet.

## Description

The aim of this project is to allow the use of the [gccrs](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs)
compiler alongside the [cargo buildsystem](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

## Setup

Since the project does not contain any releases yet, you can install it from github using
the following command:

```sh
> cargo install --git https://github.com/Rust-GCC/cargo-gccrs cargo-gccrs
```

## Usage

The goal is to provide an alternative to the classical subcommands used when working on
Rust project, such as `build`, `run` or `test`. You should simply use `cargo gccrs` instead
of `cargo` if you wish to execute commands using `gccrs` instead of `rustc`.
